# MODUS reproduction: blocked before released-model behavior

[![Open in molab](https://marimo.io/molab-shield.svg)](https://molab.marimo.io/github/alphaXiv/modus-78de6e8e/blob/main/reports/modus-reproduction/notebook.py)

We tested arXiv:2607.25948’s claims that one released MODUS checkpoint uses a shared decoder/registry, that RGB→Canny→normal improves or preserves NYUv2 surface-normal accuracy while adding latency, and that the model’s own grounding/VQA scores improve best-of-four selection. A successful Kubernetes static audit found one unified inferencer and all 16 registered modalities, but the GPU path was blocked before checkpoint construction by container system dependencies. Consequently, the paper’s 20.02°→19.87° NYUv2 result and 0.81→0.82/0.84 GenEval result have no observed reproduction number here.

The intended evaluation was downscaled to 16 fixed NYUv2 validation examples and eight fixed object-only GenEval prompts, with no synthetic replacement. Compute used Kubernetes on NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs, reached 16 concurrently allocated GPUs, and spanned 0.82 hours of actual wall time. See the [tutorial report](reports/modus-reproduction/report.md) and [self-contained marimo notebook](reports/modus-reproduction/notebook.py).

## Overview

MODUS unifies any-to-any multimodal generation in a single decoder: one causal transformer trunk shared across every modality, with no separate encoder + decoder, no modality-specific weights, and no per-task pipelines. Two experts share the same causal context:

- a **1D expert** handles discrete sequences (text, grounding boxes, DINOv2 tokens, ...) with autoregressive next-token prediction (cross-entropy);
- a **2D expert** handles continuous spatial latents (VAE + ViT features) with flow matching.

Training uses exactly two losses, summed: cross-entropy for the 1D expert and a flow-matching objective for the 2D expert. There are no segmentation/depth/detection heads and no per-task decoders; every modality goes through the same trunk. The model adapts the pretrained [BAGEL-7B](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Bagel) mixture-of-transformers.

</p>

**Capabilities**
- **Any-to-any generation:** any input modality (or set of modalities) to any output modality.
- **Chained prediction:** feed a generated output back in as a condition for the next step.
- **Cross-modal self-verification:** use the same model's grounding / VQA outputs to score generated candidates against a condition.
- **Representation composition:** condition on ViT features, VAE features, or both.

## Modalities

Modalities are not hard-coded. Each is a `ModalitySpec` in `core/modality.py`, assembled into a `ModalityRegistry` from a YAML file in `conf/modalities/`. A spec declares the modality's kind, its token range for cross-entropy slicing, positional-embedding handling, and inference decoding, so the model, dataset packing, and inference share one source of truth.

The released registry (`conf/modalities/instruction_16mod_stage2.yaml`) defines 16 modalities. **Expert** indicates which branch handles it: **2D** = continuous latents via flow matching; **1D** = discrete tokens via next-token prediction.

| Modality | Expert | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `rgb` | 2D | RGB image |
| `depth` | 2D | Depth map |
| `normal` | 2D | Surface normals |
| `seg` | 2D | Semantic segmentation |
| `canny` | 2D | Canny edges |
| `samseg` | 2D | SAM masks |
| `samedge` | 2D | SAM edges |
| `text` | 1D | Free-form text |
| `caption` | 1D | Image caption |
| `det` | 1D | Grounding boxes |
| `cocodet` | 1D | COCO-style detection |
| `dino` | 1D | DINOv2 global features (VQ-tokenized) |
| `dinolocal` | 1D | DINOv2 patch features (VQ-tokenized) |
| `clip` | 1D | CLIP features (VQ-tokenized) |
| `imagebind` | 1D | ImageBind global features (VQ-tokenized) |
| `imagebindlocal` | 1D | ImageBind patch features (VQ-tokenized) |

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EPFL-VILAB/Modus.git && cd Modus
conda create -n modus python=3.11 -y && conda activate modus
pip install -r requirements.txt
# flash-attn is optional; a pure-SDPA fallback is used if it is absent:
# pip install flash_attn==2.5.8 --no-build-isolation
```

Core dependencies are `torch==2.5.1` and `transformers==4.49.0` (see `requirements.txt`). `torch>=2.5` is required for `flex_attention`.

**Feature targets** (`dino`, `dinolocal`, `clip`, `imagebind`) additionally need the
`fourm` VQ tokenizers from [apple/ml-4m](https://github.com/apple/ml-4m):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/apple/ml-4m.git
```

The other targets (depth, surface normals, segmentation, canny, detection, caption)
work without it.

## Model weights

The model is one self-contained folder — download it once:

```bash
huggingface-cli download EPFL-VILAB/MODUS --local-dir models/modus
```

Pass that folder as `checkpoint_path` in any command below.

## Inference

The unified CLI takes a source modality (`--condition`), a target (`--target`), and optional intermediate steps (`--intermediate`):

```bash
# RGB to depth
python infer.py --condition rgb --target depth \
    checkpoint_path=models/modus input_image=test_images/01_basil_cathedral.jpg

# RGB to DINOv2 local feature map
python infer.py --condition rgb --target dinolocal \
    checkpoint_path=models/modus input_image=test_images/01_basil_cathedral.jpg

# Caption to image
python infer.py --condition caption --target image \
    checkpoint_path=models/modus prompt="a red double-decker bus in front of a clock tower"

# Chained: caption to depth to image (feed the generated depth back in)
python infer.py --condition caption --target image --intermediate depth \
    checkpoint_path=models/modus prompt="a red double-decker bus in front of a clock tower"
```

`scripts/inference.sh` is a thin wrapper over the same CLI with usage examples for every task (any-to-any and chained).

### Interactive demo

A Gradio app exposes three tabs: any-to-any, chained prediction, and representation analysis.

```bash
export MODUS_DEMO_CHECKPOINT=models/modus   # the downloaded model folder
export BAGEL_MODEL_PATH=models/modus
python demo_modus.py --port 7860
```

## Training

Training is Hydra-configured and runs in three stages, each resuming from the previous checkpoint (all stages build the same vocabulary so checkpoints chain). Configs are in `conf/train/`; launchers in `scripts/`.

```bash
# single-node smoke test
bash scripts/modus_stage1_16mod/smoke_1node.sh

# or invoke the entrypoint directly (multi-node via torchrun / SLURM)
torchrun --nproc_per_node=<N> train.py --config modus_stage1_16mod
```

| Stage | Config | Conditioning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `modus_stage1_16mod` | single-condition, 16 modalities (resumes from BAGEL-7B-MoT) |
| 2 | `modus_stage2_16mod` | single-condition, 16 modalities |
| 3 | `modus_stage3_16mod` | up to three conditions, 16 modalities |

The stage scripts contain cluster-specific placeholders (`--account`, `MODUS_ROOT`, `--environment`); edit them for your setup.
